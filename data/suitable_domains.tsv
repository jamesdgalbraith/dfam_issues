The PHD finger binds two zinc ions using the so-called 'cross-brace' motif and is thus structurally related to the RING finger and the FYVE finger. It is not yet known if PHD fingers have a common molecular function. Several reports suggest that it can function as a protein-protein interacton domain and it was recently demonstrated that the PHD finger of p300 can cooperate with the adjacent BROMO domain in nucleosome binding in vitro. Other reports suggesting that the PHD finger is a ubiquitin ligase have been refuted as these domains were RING fingers misidentified as PHD fingers.
